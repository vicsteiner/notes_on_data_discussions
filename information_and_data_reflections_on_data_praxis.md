# The data-based definition of information
Instigating reflections about data as a hype term and our praxis

---

# Context

- Data -> Information -> Knowledge (DKI)

> Discussion:
> - Why so much emphasis on data?
> - Why we are not the information team or the knowledge team or the DI & K Team?
> - Do we deliver data, information, knowledge or all of them?

# General Definition of Information (GDI)

- **data + meaning**

The operational standard in fields that treat data and information as **reified** entities (more "concrete" or "real" entities that can be manipulated).

GDI: $\sigma$ is an instance of information, understood as semantic content if and only if:
- GDA.1: $\sigma$ consists of $n$ $data$ for $data \geq 1$;
- GDA.2. the data are well-formed (syntax);
- GDA.3. the well-formed data are meaningful (semantics).

---

# A **chosen** system, code or language

> **Syntax:** data is according to the rules that govern the **chosen** system.
> **Semantics:** data comply with the meanings (not only linguistic) of the **chosen** system.

- The term **chosen** brings a **social dimension** to the use of data for constructing information.

**Discussion:** If I need a chosen system to express data as information the very first system ever created could not be grounded on information.

---

# What is the chosen system in the context of our work?

> **Discussion:**
> - When are we doing syntax?
> - When are we producing information?
> - Are we building knowledge?
> - What is the **chosen system** in the context our work?
>   - Documentation, business processes and its relation with the data it produces ...?
> - How are we attaching the semantics part of information to our data?
>   - Documentation? Personal experience ... history ... code comments, table and column names ... Qlik?

# The symbol grounding problem

- How data can have an assigned meaning and work in a semiotic (symbolic) context?

- Note: data constituting information can be meaningful independently of an informee.


**Mention:** The **Rosetta Stone** example and the difference of a data entity containing semantic information and the **accessibility** or not of it by an informee.

> **Discussion:**
> - Can data have their own semantics independently of a informer and therefore independently of a chosen system, at least chosen by humans? The idea of *environmental information*.
> - Do we have Rosetta Stones in Promofarma?

# Understanding data

# An example to start

<style scoped>section { font-size: 25px; }</style>

- Suppose you have a page from a book written in a language you do not know.
- It is a regular pattern so we assume it complies the unknown language syntax.
- However, we do not now their meaning so we have no information although we have the data.
- If we erase half of the words we may say we still have half of the data (and not much about the impact on the information).
- Erase all the remaining words but one.
- Then we might conclude that data is some sort of **representation**.
- Erase the last word.
- Do we still have data?
- Yes, since there is still a difference between the presence of a white page and a white page where things could be written.
- Similar to the what a pause is in music or the 0 in a binary system.
- One can only eliminate data completely by eliminating all possible differences.

# Diaphoric (diaphora = difference) interpretation

- Datum can be reduced ultimately to the lack of uniformity.

> **Discussion:**
> - Statistics and its emphasis on understanding the variability. Finding patterns is being able to "see" (who sees? humans, machines, systems) regularity in the differences. Randomness is the opposite.

---

# Definition of Datum:

- Datum: $x$ being distinct $y$, where $x$ and $y$ are two uninterpreted variables and the relation of *"being distinct"*, as well as the domain, are left open for further interpretation.

---

# Applications of the definition

1. Lack of uniformity in the real world - **independent of human perception**.
   1. **dedomena**: "data in the wild" or data before being interpreted or subject to any cognitive process
2. Lack of uniformity between the **perception** of at least two physical states of a system or signals.
3. Lack of uniformity between two symbols.

---

# Data and Support

Similar to information depending on syntactically well-formed data, data depends on the occurrence of differences variously **implementable physically**.

Information can easily be decoupled from its support.

The actual format, medium, language in which data, and hence information, are encoded is often irrelevant and disregardable.

# Analogue versus digital data

The systems that encode, store, process or transmit are

> Analogue if it varies continuously.
>    - Record
>    - Operations are determined by the measurement of continuous, physical transformations.
>    - Operates in real-time.
>    - Cannot be general-purpose machines.

> Digital if it varies discretely.
>    - Encode and Record

Computer digital/discrete?

# Binary data

Digital data encoded by means of two symbols.

Advantages over other possible digital systems is that it provides a common ground where

1. semantic (meaning True/False),
2. mathematical logic,
3. physics and
4. information theory

can converge.

# Types of data/information

1. Primary data
   - What is in question.
2. Secondary data
   - The data/information you get by noting that the primary information is missing.
3. Metadata
4. Operational data
   - Data about the system managing your data.
5. Derivative data
   - When data gives not only information about what was it intended but about other aspects of the system signal it is measuring.
6. Environmental data
   - When data might be "meaningful" independently of a *producer/informer*.

# Information as semantic content

When data is well-formed and meaningful.

Two senses:

1. Instructional information
   1. Can be a type of environmental information or semantic content.
2. Factual information (See Chapter 4 of the book)
   1. well-formed, meaningful and **veridic** data.
   2. A necessary condition for knowledge.

# Thanks for listening!

1. Questions?
2. Existential doubts?
3. Confuse about the nature of reality?
